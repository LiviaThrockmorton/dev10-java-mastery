# dev10-java-mastery
This is a project that I was assigned and completed during my Dev10 training. Here are the assignment details:

## Introduction
Using everything you've learned in Java Fundamentals, design, implement, and test an application that allows a user to reserve accommodations for a guest with a host. Don't Wreck My House is similar to Airbnb. A guest chooses a place to stay for a specific date range. If the host location is available, it may be reserved by the guest. Reserved locations are not available to other guests during reserved dates.

## High-Level Requirements
The application user is an accommodation administrator. They pair guests to hosts to make reservations.

- The administrator may view existing reservations for a host.
- The administrator may create a reservation for a guest with a host.
- The administrator may edit existing reservations.
- The administrator may cancel a future reservation.
